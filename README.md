# Augmented-reality-book-reading-app
This project is an android application that uses marker-based augmented
reality. This project aims to make reading interactive. By using this app, users
can go to websites, interact with 3D objects, do cognitive improvement
activities, watch videos, create 3D objects, and many more. Graphical 3D
models, audio, video, 3D text, UI buttons, virtual buttons are some of the
elements used in this project. Two physical reading materials are used in this
project: a real estate magazine and a children’s book. The pages of these act
as markers. This app demonstrates how AR can be used for smart marketing
by using simulations, videos, images, and audios in an interactive and
educational way. The user can get an idea of how buildings look, cost, and feel,
and can decide if that’s what they want. In the children’s book, there are
various activities designed to develop the different cognitive abilities of the
child, including games that focus on math, recognizing patterns, and creating
and coloring a forest.
